# Countdown Timer (Git Merge Exercise)

This repository contains a simple [React](https://react.dev/)-based countdown timer application built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/). Several features of the application have already been implemented, each of them in a separate branch. The goal of this exercise is to merge these branches into the main branch using Git.

Most of the branches in this exercise can be merged to `main` automatically, as they do not conflict with any previous changes. However, you will encounter at least one merge conflict that you will need to resolve manually. Don't worry, as conflicts are a normal part of working with Git, and resolving them is a valuable skill to learn.

In this exercise you will not need to write any new code, but you will need to understand a bit of the existing code. Although the code uses React and TypeScript, you don't need to be an expert in either of these. The merge conflicts require mainly understanding in HTML and perhaps a bit of JavaScript. Adding new code or making new changes is technically allowed, as long as the required features are merged, but it can lead to increased complexity.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need Node.js and npm installed on your machine to run the application and to complete the exercise. Alternatively, if you are familiar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), you can use the provided [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) to run the application in a container.


## Cloning the repository and listing branches

Branches can be merged both in GitHub and in your local copy of the Git repository. In this exercise, you will be merging the branches **in your local copy of the repository**. You can use either the command line or a GUI client to do this.

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command. Then, navigate to the cloned repository and see a list of branches using the `git branch` command. Use the command `git branch --all` to view all branches, including remote branches:

```bash
git fetch            # fetch the latest changes from the remote repository

git branch           # list local branches
git branch --all     # list all branches
```

Alternatively, you can also use a GUI client to view the branches. In this case refer to the documentation of your client to see how to list the remote branches.

These commands are documented in more detail in the Git documentation:

* [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)
* [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch)
* [git branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch)

At the starting point of the exercise, the output of the `git branch --all` command should look something like this:

```
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/feature/adjust-time
  remotes/origin/feature/countdown
  remotes/origin/feature/pause-resume
  remotes/origin/feature/styling
  remotes/origin/feature/workflows
  remotes/origin/main
```

## Visualizing the branches

Sometimes it is hard to understand the relationships between branches and commits in Git. Visualizing the branches can help understand the structure of the repository and how the branches are related to each other. There are multiple commercial and open-source tools available to visualize Git branches, including command line tools and GUI clients. Git also comes with a few built-in tools.

For example, you can use the `git log` command with the `--graph` option to visualize the commit history and branches in the command line. This will show a graphical representation of the commit history, including branches and merges. Use the `--oneline` and `--all` options to show all branches and commits in a simplified format:

```bash
# run this command in the exercise folder
git log --all --graph --oneline
```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in `gitk` tool to visualize the branches in a GUI. This tool provides a graphical representation of the commit history, including branches and merges. It also allows you to view the commit messages and diffs for each commit. To use `gitk`, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
# run this command in the exercise folder
gitk --all
```

At the starting point of the exercise, the branch structure looks approximately like this:

```mermaid
%% This is a mermaid diagram which can be rendered by your markdown tool,
%% or you can preview it in https://mermaid.live
gitGraph
   commit id: "Initial commit"
   commit id: "Docker polling fix"
   commit id: "Instructions for the exercise"
   branch feature/countdown
   checkout feature/countdown
   commit id: "Countdown interval"
   branch feature/pause-resume
   checkout feature/pause-resume
   commit id: "Pause/resume feature"
   checkout feature/countdown
   branch feature/adjust-time
   checkout feature/adjust-time
   commit id: "Update time every second"
   commit id: "Adjust time buttons"
   checkout main
   branch feature/styling
   checkout feature/styling
   commit id: "Add Pico CSS"
   commit id: "Styling for countdown"
   checkout main
   commit id: "Several..."
   commit id: "...commits..."
   commit id: "here..."
   branch feature/workflows
   commit id: "Workflow for building"
   commit id: "Workflow for autograding"
```


## 1. Getting started (the `main` branch)

The initial version of the app in the `main` branch has the basic project set up, but the countdown timer is not yet functional. Start by installing the project's dependencies, starting a development server and opening the app in your browser. You can do this by locally by running the following commands:

```bash
# install dependencies from package.json
npm install

# start the development server
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can use Docker and build and run the app in a container with the following command:

```bash
# build and run the app in a container
docker-compose up --build
```

Regardless of the method you use, the app should now be running and accessible in your browser at the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open your browser and navigate to that URL to verify that the initial state of the app is working. Keep visiting the app in your browser after each merge to verify that the app is working and that the changes are applied correctly.

Note that the time on the screen is not counting down, as it will be implemented in the next steps. If the first steps fail due to any issues, make sure to fix them before proceeding. It is not ideal to get stuck on installation issues, as they are not the focus of this exercise.


## 2. Merge the `feature/workflows` branch (fast-forwarding)

The `feature/workflows` branch contains GitHub workflows that automate building the application and grading the exercise. This branch should be merged into the `main` branch first.

Start by checking out the `feature/workflows` branch and reviewing the files in the `.github/workflows` folder:

```bash
git checkout feature/workflows

branch 'feature/workflows' set up to track 'origin/feature/workflows'.
Switched to a new branch 'feature/workflows'
```

As you can see, git created a new local branch called `feature/workflows` that tracks the remote branch with the same name. You can now review the workflow files in the [`.github/workflows` folder](./.github/workflows).

You do not need to investigate or modify the workflows, but it is important to understand that adding them automates the process of building the application and grading the exercise. The workflows are triggered automatically when you push your code to the remote repository.

**Merging**

When you are ready to merge the `feature/workflows` branch into the `main` branch, switch back to the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout main

Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

The `feature/workflows` branch can be ["fast-forwarded"](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge) into the `main` branch, as the main branch does not have any local changes that are not already in the `feature/workflows` branch. This means that the `main` branch can be "fast-forwarded" to the latest commit in the `feature/workflows` branch without creating a separate merge commit.

Use the following resources to learn how to merge branches in Git:

* [Git merge (Atlassian)](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge)

After successfully merging the `feature/workflows` branch into the `main` branch, push your local `main` branch back to the remote repository using the `git push` command. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflows to run. You can check the status of the workflows by navigating to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository:

<img alt="Two workflows in the actions tab" src="./screenshots/workflows.png" width="400" />

The "Build the project" workflow should succeed, but the "Autograding Tests" workflow will fail, as you have not completed the exercise yet. You can ignore this for now, as you will fix it in the next steps.


## 3. Merge the `feature/countdown` branch (automatic merge)

The `feature/countdown` branch implements the countdown timer functionality so that the time on the screen counts down from the initial 15 minutes. This is a key feature of the application, and it is important to merge this branch into the `main` branch before any other features.

Merging the `feature/countdown` branch into the `main` branch should be straightforward. Even though both branches have changed, none of the files have changed in both branches, so there will be no need to resolve any conflicts.

You can either create a local branch that tracks the remote `feature/countdown` branch and then merge it into `main`, or you can merge the remote branch directly into `main` without creating a local branch. Checking out the branch first is recommended, as it allows you to review the changes before merging. If you choose to merge the remote branch directly without creating a local branch, you will need to refer to it as `origin/feature/countdown`:

```bash
# Option A: create a local branch and merge it:
git checkout feature/countdown
# ...then review the changes, move back to main and merge

# Option B: merge the remote branch directly:
git merge origin/feature/countdown
```

**The merge commit**

When merging this branch, Git will create a new merge commit in the `main` branch to record the merge. You can provide a custom commit message for the merge commit if you wish, or you can use the default message provided by Git. If you are using Git inside VS Code, you can enter the commit message in the text area and close it to complete the merge. If you are using the command line, Git will open the default text editor for you to enter the commit message. Depending on your Git configuration, the default editor may be Vim, Nano, or another text editor, that might require some learning if you are not familiar with it. There is a super popular [Stack Overflow discussion that discusses exiting Vim](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/), which has been viewed millions of times.

After merging the `feature/countdown` branch, verify that the countdown timer is working correctly by refreshing the page in your browser and restarting the Vite process if necessary. You should see the countdown timer counting down from 15 minutes to 0:

<img alt="Timer with countdown" src="./screenshots/countdown.png" width="400" />

If you encounter any issues, make sure to check both the terminal and the browser console for any error messages. If you see any errors, make sure to fix them before proceeding. When the timer works as expected, push your code to the remote repository and see the GitHub Actions workflows again. The building workflow should succeed and you should see more points in the grading workflow.


## 4. Merge the `feature/styling` branch (automatic merge)

Some of the users of our app have reported that the app looks a bit boring and they would like to see some styling improvements. The `feature/styling` branch implements some basic styling for the app, including an automatic dark mode switch based on the user's system settings.

Following the same approach as in the previous step, merge the `feature/styling` branch into the `main` branch. You can either review the changes in a local branch first or merge the remote branch directly into `main` without creating a local branch.

There should not be any merge conflicts when merging this branch, as the changes in this branch do not overlap with the previous changes. However, as both branches have modifications, Git will create a new merge commit, where you can provide a custom commit message if you wish.

After merging, verify that the styling changes are applied correctly by refreshing the page in your browser. You should see a more polished and visually appealing app:

<img alt="Timer with styles applied" src="./screenshots/styling.png" width="400" />

Then, push your code to the remote repository and check the GitHub Actions workflows again. The "build" workflow should succeed and you should see more points in the "grading" workflow.


## 5. Merge the `feature/pause-resume` branch (automatic merge)

Now that the countdown timer works, an important feature that users have requested is the ability to pause and resume the countdown timer. The `feature/pause-resume` branch implements this feature. Continue by merging this branch into the `main` branch and verify that you can pause and resume the countdown timer by clicking the buttons below the counter:

<img alt="Timer with pause and resume buttons" src="./screenshots/pause-resume.png" width="400" />

When you have verified that the changes are correct and that the app works as expected, push your code to GitHub and check the GitHub Actions workflows again. The building workflow should still succeed, and you should see more points in the grading workflow.


## 6. Merge the `feature/adjust-time` branch (merge conflict)

Many users have reported that they would like to be able to adjust the countdown time. The `feature/adjust-time` branch implements this feature, allowing users to adjust the countdown time either before starting the timer or during countdown.

Unfortunately, while the `feature/adjust-time` branch implements this cool feature, it has been developed in parallel with the `feature/pause-resume` branch. This means that both branches contain changes in the same lines of code in the [Timer.tsx](./src/Timer.tsx) file, which Git cannot automatically resolve. This is a common situation when working with Git, and it is important to learn how to resolve merge conflicts.

Start the merge process as before, either by creating a local branch that tracks the remote `feature/adjust-time` branch and then merging it into `main`, or by merging the remote `origin/feature/adjust-time` branch directly into `main` without creating a local branch.

This time, Git will notify you about a merge conflict:

```
Auto-merging src/Timer.tsx
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/Timer.tsx
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

To complete a conflicting merge, you will need to resolve the conflicts manually. You can use the command `git status` at any time to see the status of the repository and instructions about what to do next:

```
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   src/Timer.tsx
```

Resolving the conflicts require a few steps:

1. take note of the files containing conflicts reported by `git status`
2. review and edit the conflicting files one by one to fix the conflicts
3. verify that the changes are correct and that the app still works as expected: `npm run dev`
4. mark the edited files as resolved with `git add`
5. commit the changes with `git commit`

[Resolving a merge conflict using the command line (GitHub)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)

Both branches have added new buttons in the same place, but the buttons are different. You will need to keep both sets of buttons in the final version. There is also a change in the `useEffect` section in the code, that now checks if the timer is `running` or not. You should keep the "current version" of the `useEffect` function and `running` variable, as they were a part of the previously merged into `main` from the `feature/pause-resume` branch.

<img alt="UI with both pause/resume and adjust time buttons" src="./screenshots/adjust-time.png" width="400" />

When you have modified the file make sure that the timer app works as expected. You should be able to adjust the time using the new buttons, as well as pause and resume the timer. After the issue is resolved, mark the file as resolved using `git add src/Timer.tsx`, and then continue the merge by committing the changes with `git commit`. Note that you should not define a commit message, as Git is already in the middle of a merge and will use the default merge commit message.

When you have committed the changes, push your code to GitHub and check the GitHub Actions workflows again. The building workflow should still succeed, and you should now get all points in the grading workflow.
